==1. Tagging Content [1 week]==
  * In the web interface, add the ability to tag questions and answers
  * Content can have up to two tags: crop and/or topic
  * Place the tag fields in the details panel which currently has Name, location, etc. fields, but make tagging mandatory before content is approved or rejected

==2. Alerts [2 weeks]==
When new content of interest (at this time limit this to an answer to a posted question) has been posted to AO, the system leaves you a missed call.

==3. Personal Inbox [1 week]==
  * A third option for each forum, enabled through a new forum parameter
  * 3 suboptions
    ** Listen to threads which you are an author of, by most recently posted
    ** Listen to recommended content. Implement this as any content that matches the crop tags of personal content. If a user has no content, then there are no recommendations so the prompt suggests asking a question.
    ** Go back to the forum

==4. Rating of Answers [1 week]==
After listening to an answer, prompt user to rate it. Asking whether you liked/didn't like is too direct and there is no incentive to truthful. The rating system needs to have a consequence to the system and the user, as is the case in Digg.
