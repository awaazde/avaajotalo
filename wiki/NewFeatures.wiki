==1. Rating of Answers (1 week)==
After listening to an answer, prompt user to rate it. Asking whether you liked/didn't like is too direct and there is no incentive to truthful. The rating system needs to have a consequence to the system and the user, as is the case in Digg. 

==2. Responder Inbox ==
If you have assigned questions for answering, display an option from the main menu that takes you there and lets you listen and respond. Would need to think about whether the interaction should be identical to the outbound interface (have update_listens, have presentation of short menu after every message), but my sense it to not. If you're going to this section from AO, you know what you're doing.

==3. Pipeline for rejected questions ==
If a question is rejected, offer something in the interface to give the user feedback, which he can then access through the personal inbox. Having the admin choose from amongst a set of canned responses is one option.
