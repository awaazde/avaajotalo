==1. Tagging Content==
  * In the web interface, add the ability to tag questions and answers
  * Content can have up to two tags: crop and/or topic
  * Place the tag fields in the details panel which currently has Name, location, etc. fields, but make tagging mandatory before content is approved or rejected

==2. Alerts==
When new content of interest (an answer to your question, answer to a question of interest, new announcements or radio program uploads) has been posted to AO, the system leaves you a missed call. This single bit of information simply means, "something new has been posted that you might be interested in", without immediately telling you what that is.

Once you call in, following the normal main menu prompt is a recording saying what is new for you (some combo of new answer, new announcement, new radio).

TAP: Id like to limit this to responses to your own questions.  Also, the second sentence will require us to maintain a lot more state then we do now. 

===Implementation Details===
  * Alerts will have to be sent via cron, periodically checking each user's last login and whether new content of interest has been posted since.

TAP: Thats a bad way to implement it.  Alerts should be sent out whenever the DB is updated.  Another reason to limit it to responses to your questions.

==3. Personal Inbox==
  * A third option for each forum, enabled through a new forum parameter
  * 3 suboptions
    ** Listen to threads which you are an author of, by most recently posted
    ** Listen to recommended content. Implement this as any content that matches the crop tags of personal content. If a user has no content, then there are no recommendations so the prompt suggests asking a question.
    ** Go back to the forum

==4. Rating of Answers==
After listening to an answer, prompt user to rate it. Asking whether you liked/didn't like is too direct and there is no incentive to truthful. The rating system needs to have a consequence to the system and the user, as is the case in Digg. 

==Prompts Needed==
  * Inbox top-level option
  * Inbox suboptions
  * Inbox empty personal or recommended threads
  * Alert messages for each section
