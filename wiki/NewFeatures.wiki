==1. Responder Inbox (P1)==
If you have assigned questions for answering, display an option from the main menu that takes you there and lets you listen and respond. Would need to think about whether the interaction should be identical to the outbound interface (have update_listens, have presentation of short menu after every message), but my sense is not. If you're going to this section from AO, you know what you're doing.  (TAP: My intuition *is* to have it as close to the same as possible.)

==2. Pipeline for rejected questions ==
If a question is rejected, offer something in the interface to give the user feedback, which he can then access through the personal inbox. Having the admin choose from amongst a set of canned responses is one option.  Also, provide another option to search for prior responses that answer this question.  Currently, its fine to search using existing metadata (Tags, User, etc.)  Should also allow uploading of custom response, if not already supported.

==3. Reporting ==
Provide summary usage reports, including frequent callers, frequent askers, frequent successful askers, frequent responders, etc.  This will be used for rewards, monitoring and control (for example, in a toll free line tracking users who are making excessive calls).

==4. Custom Calling Schedules (P1)==
Allow experts to set custom calling schedules.  At least support calling twice a day.

==5. Register Users ==
Allow registering users for specific lines / forums, and specifying "closed" lines and/or forums that only registered users can call and/or listen to.  Again, particularly useful for toll free lines.

==6. Random Message Access ==
Allow accessing random messages for a forum, perhaps through numeric serial numbers.  Motivating app: can be used to set up per-video messages for DG.

==7. Web Front End ==
Provide a web-based front end for browsing, listening to, and possibly even responding to messages, intended for end users, diaspora, etc. (and not only admins)

==8. Message Move / Export ==
Allow moving / copying messages between forums.  Also allo exporting a list of messages, for burning onto an MP3 CD.

==9. Party Line / Conference ==
Support setting up a party line / conference call, as their own "synchronous fora".

==10. Messaging Framework ==
SMS alerts, including tag, user, other metadata.  In the future can support sending transcribed messages / responses via SMS.  We also want to support asking questions via SMS, and MMS / E-mail, which could include images, for example of plant diseases or pests.

==11. Rating of Answers ==
After listening to an answer, prompt user to rate it. Asking whether you liked/didn't like is too direct and there is no incentive to truthful. The rating system needs to have a consequence to the system and the user, as is the case in Digg.  (TAP: My intuition is to provide an explicit prompt after the message if desired.)
