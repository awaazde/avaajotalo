'''
Allow some buffer of time to look for audio to convert,
in order to avoid race conditions with remote syncing of files.

This is needed in a case where
1. A file is recorded on a remote server
2. The remote server executes an rsync within X min (where X is how often the cron runs)
3. In X + epsilon, the audio converter spots message, sees a wav file that is partially
uploaded, but begins conversion anyway.

We need to make sure conversion only happens after sync is complete.
The best way is to taskify syncing and make conversion happen after that, but
this is a temporary solution. The downside to this approach is there will
be further delay for a mp3 file to be created, hence playback in the console
will be further delayed.

The shortest you can make this BUFFER is how often the sync crons run.
If you make it longer, it is being more conservative, but it can't be any
shorter
